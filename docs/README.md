# File System Tool

## Overview

The **File System Tool** is a Python application designed to create directory structures and files based on a predefined structure specified in a text file. It also manages the installation of packages via Python's `pip` and Node.js's `npm`, providing a convenient way to set up project environments quickly.

## Features

- Create directory structures and files based on a specified structure file.
- Install packages using Python's `pip` and Node.js's `npm`.
- Log operations and errors for troubleshooting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Node.js and npm (for managing Node packages)
- Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts and manage packages

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd FileSystemTool
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages:**

   Make sure you have `pip` installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Node.js packages:**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install <package_name>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the main script:**

   To execute the application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Configuration:**

   - Update the `project_root` variable in `main.py` with the desired root directory where you want to create the structure.
   - Specify the path to the structure file in the `structure_file` variable.

3. **Structure File Format:**

   The structure file should represent directories and files using indentation. For example:

   ```
   project/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main.py
   │   ├── file_operations.py
   │   └── package_manager.py
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── test_file_operations.py
   │   └── test_package_manager.py
   └── docs/
       └── README.md
   ```

## Project Structure

```
FileSystemTool/
|-- src/
|   |-- main.py
|   |-- file_operations.py
|   |-- package_manager.py
|   |-- logger.py
|   |-- node.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- test_file_operations.py
|   |-- test_package_manager.py
|-- docs/
|   |-- README.md
|-- requirements.txt
|-- .gitignore
```

## Logging

The application utilizes a logging mechanism to record operations and errors. Logs are saved in `file_system_tool.log`. Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where the script is executed.
